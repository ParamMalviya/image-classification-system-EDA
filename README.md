# Image Classification System - EDA

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **ImageNet** dataset, focusing on dataset understanding, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and pre-processing techniques to improve AI-based image classification models.

## Objectives:
1. **Dataset Exploration**: Analyze dataset characteristics such as the number of classes, image resolution, and variations.
2. **Class Imbalance**: Identify class imbalances and explore strategies for addressing them.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features like color histograms, texture features, and edges.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA and t-SNE for visualizing high-dimensional data.
5. **Quality Insights**: Detect and assess noise, blur, and outliers within the dataset.
6. **Pre-processing Recommendations**: Suggest techniques like data augmentation and normalization to improve model performance.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis is **ImageNet**, a large-scale dataset used for image classification and object detection tasks.
